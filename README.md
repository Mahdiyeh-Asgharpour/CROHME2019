# CROHME 2019 Project

This project implements a deep learning approach for handwritten mathematical expression recognition using the CROHME 2019 dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature extraction from input images, and training a neural model based on a CNN-RNN with attention mechanism to generate LaTeX sequences. The notebook provides a complete pipeline for training, evaluation, and reproducibility of results.
